Ariana Grande,Feminism (Quotes),,None,when will people stop being offended by women showing skin  expressing sexuality men take their shirts off  express their sexuality onstage in videos on instagram anywhere they want to all the time the double standard is so boring and exhausting with all due respect i think it's time you get your head out of your ass sic women can love their bodies too  responding to a commenter who said she was like a whore in her dangerous woman video on facebook  the incredible double standard that we women face on a daily basis in the industry and just in the world it's shocking i would be so amused and pardon me if this comes across as sexist but i don't think a male artist would be in this position right now sorry if i'm speaking about something that i'm passionate about i'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what i believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that i will always be one of the first to speak up about  is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between  is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between  you need a little brushing up on equality over here  i have a long list of things i'd like to change  i think judgement in general intolerance meanness double standards misogyny racism sexism you know all that shit there's lots we've got to get started on that's what we need to focus on we've got work to do  responding to the question if you could use makeup or your phone one last time what would you pick on california's power 06 fm  i'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy i'm not big sean's ex i'm not niall's new possible girl i'm ariana grande  to the sun  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i  do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you  i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating married attached to having sex with or not seen with  but by their value as an individual   people are so ignorant sometimes stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies it's okay to be different  to be curvy or to be thin when did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies we were having fun dancing on stage 'what's she shaking tho' i'm shaking my pretty cute petite ass next to nicki's pretty big booty both are fing awesome how about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are that would be nice so tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down  on instagram  gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled 'after black power women's liberation' and 46 years later  we're still not quite there yet if a woman has lots of sex or any sex for that matter  she's a 'slut' if a man has sex  he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly  she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used 'bitches'hoes'  how lovely he's had  he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevatedcelebrated  on twitter,None

Ariana Grande,Open Letter to Fans,,2014-07-14,so the news is out about sam  cat i felt it wasnt my place to make any sort of announcement so i kept quiet until now i want to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character     but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies   thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you forever,2014

Ariana Grande,Open Letter Critiquing Sexism,,None,being empowered is not the same as being a bitch having something to say is not the same as having a bad attitude  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you i have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because i have come to the realization that i have so much more to talk about i'm currently making the best music i've ever made in my life having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people i've ever known working my ass off every single day performing  creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day  i come from a long bloodline of female activists my aunt judy was the first italian american female president of the national press club in washington dc i think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled after black power women's liberation and 46 years later we're still not quite there yet if a women has a lot of sex or any sex for that matter she's a slut if a man has sex he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used bitcheshoes how lovely he's had he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated  celebrated aww shiiit he smashed  i know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating  married to  attached to having sex with or not  seen with but by their value as an individual  i want the people reading this to know that they are more than enough on their own i want the media to please help me with this please support each other i'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like i constantly had to have a boy by my side after being on my own now for a few months i am realizing that that's just not the case i have never felt more present grounded and satisfied i've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more  one more thought my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as i can with my fans that is something i have done since day one and never plan on changing it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny special personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things i've done  things i'm going through i don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before i love y'all with all my heart you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me  any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke she will need her sisterhood  gloria steinem,None
