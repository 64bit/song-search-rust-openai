95,Taylor Swift,Reputation [Prologue],reputation,2017,2017-11-10,here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation

154,Taylor Swift,I Know Places (Voice Memo),1989 (Deluxe),2014,2014-10-27,so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that's why i'm still so in love with song writing so what i've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i'd always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can't stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door they're around and the vultures come around and you know that they won't they won't us say what they want 'bout say what they want 'bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i'm not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run  baby i know some places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places  uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places  or whatever i don't know but that's basically just like a dark really dark lyric like  thing and it's about like everybody's like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just whatever you know and the  would just go to that major and just be like ooh  so i hope you like it it wouldn't be a piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now i'm just making weird sounds hope you like it

191,Taylor Swift,Lover [Foreword],,2019,2019-08-23,when i found old diaries from my childhood and my teens they were covered in dust i'm not just saying that for poetic effect they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes i used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments i'd practice my autograph and tape my  picks to the pages in the entries i daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous i was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game i frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love friends confidence and trust i vented described memories in detail jotted down new song ideas and questioned why i would ever try to shoot for a career i had such a small chance of ever attaining  but what shocked me the most was how often i wrote down the things i loved writing a new song riding in the car with my mom the purplepink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting the dazzle of opal necklaces i couldnt afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case i wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such wonderment intrigue romance i noticed things and decided they were romantic and so they were  in life we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be how to act or how to be happy like invisible smoke in the room we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life we constantly question our choices our surroundings and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes all the while we crave romance we long for those rare enchanting moments when things just fall into place above all else we really really want our lives to be filled with love  i've decided that in this life i want to be defined by the things i love not the things i hate the things i'm afraid of or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night those things may be struggles but they're not my identity i wish the same for you may your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud clergies voices of those who love and appreciate you turn those voices up in the mix in your head may you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them may you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you didn't i hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed i hope that if there is a lover in your life it's someone who deserves you if that's the case i hope you treat them with care  this album is a love letter to love itself all the captivating spellbinding maddening devastating red blue gray golden aspects of it that's why there are so many songs in honor of fever dreams bad boys confessions of love on a drunken night out christmas lights still hanging in january  string scars on my hands false gods and blind faith memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light finally finding a friend and opening the curtains to see the clearest brightest daylight after the darkest night  we are what we love this is lover

225,Taylor Swift,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30,,2019,2019-03-06,according to my birth certificate i turn 0 this year it's weird because part of me still feels 8 and part of me feels 8 but the actual age i currently am is 9 i've heard people say that your thirties are the most fun so i'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when i know but until then i thought i'd share some lessons i've learned before reaching 0 because it's 09 and sharing is caring  lesson   i learned to block some of the noise social media can be great but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you arent how youre failing or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment one thing i do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments yes i keep comments off on my posts that way im showing my friends and fans updates on my life but im training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that i look  im also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while im having my coffee at nine in the morning i think its healthy for your selfesteem to need less internet praise to appease it especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist an actual comment i received once  lesson   being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble while it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady this can contribute to some of your lifes worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you grow a backbone trust your gut and know when to strike back be like a snakeonly bite if someone steps on you  lesson   trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal it may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture you had to give me one moment of bitterness come on but that said its good to mess up and learn from it and take risks its especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching thats good well always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace no this is not an excuse to text your ex right now thats not what i said or do it whatever maybe youll learn from it then youll probably forget what you learned and do it again but its fine do you youre searching  lesson 4  i learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body i worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves shinier hair and more energy i think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting but taking it too far can be really dangerous there is no quick fix i work on accepting my body every day  lesson 5  banish the drama you only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it be discerning if someone in your life is hurting you draining you or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable blocking their number isnt cruel its just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it  lesson 6  ive learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we arent allowed to age its an impossible standard to meet and ive been loving how outspoken jameela jamil has been on this subject reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women were supposed to defy gravity time and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isnt even remotely required of men  lesson 7  my biggest fear after the manchester arena bombing and the vegas concert shooting i was completely terrified to go on tour this time because i didnt know how we were going to keep  million fans safe over seven months there was a tremendous amount of planning expense and effort put into keeping my fans safe my fear of violence has continued into my personal life i carry quikclot army grade bandage dressing which is for gunshot or stab wounds websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address ive ever had online you get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things every day i try to remind myself of the good in the world the love ive witnessed and the faith i have in humanity we have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears  lesson 8  i learned not to let outside opinions establish the value i place on my own life choices for too long the projected opinions of strangers affected how i viewed my relationships whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture i posted on instagram that stuff isnt real for an approval seeker like me it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my own value system of what i actually want  lesson 9  i learned how to make some easy cocktails like pimms cups aperol spritzes oldfashioneds and mojitos because06  lesson 0  ive always cooked a lot but i found three recipes i know ill be making at dinner parties for life ina gartens real meatballs and spaghetti i just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat nigella lawsons mughlai chicken and jamie olivers chicken fajitas with molé sauce getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer i also learned how to immediately calculate celsius to fahrenheit in my head which is what im pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex  lesson   recently i discovered command tape and i definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if id hung things that way all along this is not an ad i just really love command tape  lesson   apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you even if it was unintentional its so easy to just apologize and move on try not to say im sorry but and make excuses for yourself learn how to make a sincere apology and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships  lesson   its my opinion that in cases of sexual assault i believe the victim coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through i know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing awful experience i believe victims because i know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying this happened to me its something no one would choose for themselves we speak up because we have to and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we dont  lesson 4  when tragedy strikes someone you know in a way youve never dealt with before its okay to say that you dont know what to say sometimes just saying youre so sorry is all someone wants to hear its okay to not have any helpful advice to give them you dont have all the answers however its not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour your support is all someone needs when theyre at their lowest point even if you cant really help the situation its nice for them to know that you would if you could  lesson 5  vitamins make me feel so much better i take ltheanine which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety i also take magnesium for muscle health and energy  lesson 6  before you jump in headfirst maybe i dont knowget to know someone all that glitters isnt gold and first impressions actually arent everything its impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room but what i know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them i call it a solid first 5 but the layers of a person you discover in time are they honest selfaware and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it do they show up for you when you need them do they still love you after theyve seen you broken or after theyve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if theyre people these are things a first impression could never convey  lesson 7  after my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a sharpie as eyeliner do not do it i felt like i needed to start being nicer to my skin i now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after i shower not just in the winter but all year round because why cant i be soft during all the seasons  lesson 8  realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them for example never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me even as an adult i still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at in my twenties i found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend so i shouted it from the rooftops posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood without realizing that other people might still feel the way i did when i felt so alone its important to address our longstanding issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them  lesson 9  playing mind games is for the chase in a real relationship or friendship youre shooting yourself in the foot if you dont tell the other person how you feel and what could be done to fix it no one is a mind reader if someone really loves you they want you to verbalize how you feel this is real life not chess  lesson 0  learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships something about were in our young twenties hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family and maybe they will be for the rest of your life or maybe theyll just be your comrades for an important phase but not forever its sad but sometimes when you grow you outgrow relationships you may leave behind friendships along the way but youll always keep the memories  lesson   fashion is all about playful experimentation if you dont look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe youre doing it wrong see bleachella  lesson   how to fight fair with the ones you love chances are youre not trying to hurt the person you love and they arent trying to hurt you if you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from theres a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who won the fight i know a couple who in the thick of a fight say hey same team find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built they dont give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship they just give out divorce papers  lesson   i learned that i have friends and fans in my life who dont care if im canceled they were there in the worst times and theyre here now the fans and their care for me my wellbeing and my music were the ones who pulled me through the most emotional part of the reputation stadium tour for me was knowing i was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up ill never forget the ones who stuck around  lesson 4  ive had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family both of my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again its taught me that there are real problems and then theres everything else my moms cancer is a real problem i used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs i give all of my worry stress and prayers to real problems now  lesson 5  i remember people asking me what are you gonna write about if you ever get happy theres a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art that art and suffering go hand in hand im really grateful to have learned this isnt true finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool  lesson 6  i make countdowns for things im excited about when ive gone through dark low times ive always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app theyre free and adding things im looking forward to even if theyre not big holidays or anything its good to look toward the future sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now and its good to get some perspective that life will always go on to better things  lesson 7  i learned that disarming someones petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh in my experience ive come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously a few years ago someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet the fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than ive ever felt in my life but i cant tell you how hard i had to keep from laughing every time my 6foot inflatable cobra named karyn appeared onstage in front of 60000 screaming fans its the stadium tour equivalent of responding to a trolls hateful instagram comment with lol it would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us but maybe all ill ever get is the satisfaction of knowing i could survive it and thrive in spite of it  lesson 8  im finding my voice in terms of politics i took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our daytoday life i saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk and felt like i had to speak up to try and help make a change only as someone approaching 0 did i feel informed enough to speak about it to my 4 million followers invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what i want from our leaders and i realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric im going to do more to help we have a big race coming up next year  lesson 9  i learned that your hair can completely change texture from birth i had the curliest hair and now it is straight its the straight hair i wished for every day in junior high but just as i was coming to terms with loving my curls theyve left me please pray for their safe return  lesson 0  my mom always tells me that when i was a little kid she never had to punish me for misbehaving because i would punish myself even worse id lock myself in my room and couldnt forgive myself as a fiveyearold i realized that i do the same thing now when i feel ive made a mistake whether its selfimposed exile or silencing myself and isolating ive come to a realization that i need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice trusting the wrong person or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone step into the daylight and let it go

265,Taylor Swift,The Future of Music Is a Love Story,,2014,2014-07-07,where will the music industry be in 0 years 0 years 50 years  before i tell you my thoughts on the matter you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dyingit's just coming alive  there are many many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity i am not one of them in my opinion the value of an album is and will continue to be based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work and the financial value that artists and their labels place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace piracy file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically and every artist has handled this blow differently  in recent years you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away for this promotion or that exclusive deal my hope for the future not just in the music industry but in every young girl i meetis that they all realize their worth and ask for it  music is art and art is important and rare important rare things are valuable valuable things should be paid for it's my opinion that music should not be free and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is i hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art  arrows through the heart  in mentioning album sales i'd like to point out that people are still buying albums but now they're buying just a few of them they are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone it isn't as easy today as it was 0 years ago to have a multiplatinumselling album and as artists that should challenge and motivate us  there are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever the way i see it fans view music the way they view their relationships some music is just for fun a passing fling the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit that they will soon forget they ever danced to some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past  however some artists will be like finding the one we will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren as an artist this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans i think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond the one my father has with the beach boys and the one my mother has with carly simon  i think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise no i did not say shock i said surprise i believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans  in the youtube generation we live in i walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online to continue to show them something they had never seen before i brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me my generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient we want to be caught off guard delighted left in awe i hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes as challenging as that might be  there are a few things i have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years the first being autographs i haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iphone with a frontfacing camera the only memento kids these days want is a selfie it's part of the new currency which seems to be how many followers you have on instagram  fan power  a friend of mine who is an actress told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses the casting director chose the actress with more twitter followers i see this becoming a trend in the music industry for me this dates back to 005 when i walked into my first recordlabel meetings explaining to them that i had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called myspace in the future artists will get record deals because they have fansnot the other way around  another theme i see fading into the gray is genre distinction these days nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence the wild unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes pop sounds like hip hop country sounds like rock rock sounds like soul and folk sounds like countryand to me that's incredible progress i want to make music that reflects all of my influences and i think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a careerdefining path and more of an organizational tool  this moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless in this moment in music stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded and sonic evolution is not only acceptedit is celebrated the only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all  celebrity spotlight  i predict that some things will never change there will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians especially the younger ones artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s '80s and '90s tell me it was never this crazy for us back then and i suspect i'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday god help them there continues to be a bad girl vs good girlcleancut vs sexy debate and for as long as those labels exist i just hope there will be contenders on both sides everyone needs someone to relate to  and as for me i'll just be sitting back and growing old watching all of this happen or not happen all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism  and i'd also like a nice garden

taylor swift the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like four hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but i wrote this one in literally 5 minutes and ya know i really didn't think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so i kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single but um my label heard it and was like we're putting that outlaughing  tim mcgraw well i'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya  radio dj so i so i understand that you two guys have not talked  tim mcgraw no  radio dj you haven't met  tim mcgraw no  taylor swift no we've never talked or met or anything  tim mcgraw i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like

chance ya know i didn't say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldn't take it too bad  tim mcgraw well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad i'm sure

one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are  tim mcgraw aww thank you  taylor swift and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and

382,Taylor Swift,Love Story (2020 Recording),,2020,2020-12-02,we were both young when i first saw you i close my eyes and the flashback starts i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air see the lights see the party the ball gowns see you make your way through the crowd and say hello little did i know  pre  that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles and my daddy said stay away from juliet and i was crying on the staircase begging you please don't go and i said    romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all therе's left to do is run you'll be the princе and i'll be the princess it's a love story baby just say yes   so i sneak out to the garden to see you we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew so close your eyes escape this town for a little while  pre  'cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter and my daddy said stay away from juliet but you were everything to me i was begging you please don't go and i said    romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess it's a love story baby just say yes romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel this love is difficult but it's real don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess it's a love story baby just say yes oh oh   i got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around my faith in you was fading when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said romeo save me i've been feeling so alone i keep waiting for you but you never come is this in my head i don't know what to think he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said    marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone i love you and that's all i really know i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress it's a love story baby just say yes   oh oh oh oh 'cause we were both young when i first saw you
383,Taylor Swift,The Power of Pop,,2019,2019-02-27,my favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story they do more than just set the scene or paint the picture the writing i love the most places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the character's does its something f scott fitzgerald did so well to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment  i'm highly biased but i think that the way music can transport you back to a longforgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when i hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks i instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania i'm clutching a  and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house when i hear i write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when i hear how to save a life by the fray breathe am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile i immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when i'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew i would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room  just being alone with those songs those are all from the grey's anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds i'm convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs   i love writing songs because i love preserving memories like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had i like to use nostalgia as inspiration when i'm writing songs for the same reason i like to take photographs i like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times i want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever  the fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of i thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being well universal you'd think that as pop writers we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones i think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and i dont mean in a shakespearean sonnet type of way although i love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story 009  in modern pop songsbopschunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour i got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from cuba singing about havana  i think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what i went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic i think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories it's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like a great book

405,Taylor Swift,Billboard Woman of the Decade Speech,,2019,2019-12-12,jameela jamil presents swift with her award  absolutely love this one right this is sort of a it's not a short speech so just i don't want this to slip and break 'cause it's very important to me  jamil takes the award from swift to hold  thank you so much she's so supportive we all need someone like that i'm taylor good evening i wanna first thank billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for   microphone stand lowers  whoa this is going great so far excellent okay i wanna say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade well it means i've seen a lot when this decade began i was 0 years old and i had put out my selftitled debut album when i was 6 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called fearless and i saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that i was really curious about i saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time  and i saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you whether you deserve to be there whether your male producer or cowriter is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label it wasn't i saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and i saw something in me change due to this realization this was the decade when i became a mirror for my detractors whatever they decided i couldn't do is exactly what i did  audience claps  huh i'll take it thanks whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples i can think of are songs like mean shake it off and blank space basically if people had something to say about me i usually said something back in my own way and this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win album of the year at the grammys and i did become the youngest  artist to ever win the award with that win came criticism and backlash in 00 that i'd never experienced before as a young new artist all of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice was it strong enough was i a little bit pitchy all of a sudden they weren't sure if i was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past i had had cowriters in the room  at that time i couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard i believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever you gotta give it to them and now i realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level i now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback but i didn't know that then  so then i decided that i would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that i would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show i decided i would be what they said i couldn't be i didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else i wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and i would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics  they're saying i'm dating too much in my twenties okay i'll stop i'll just be single for years now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs okay i'll make one about moving to new york and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music alright okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 989  audience cheers  oh you heard it sick now it's that i'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends okay i can stop doing that too now i'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman okay i'll disappear from public view for years now i'm being cast as a villain to you okay here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere  in the last ten years i have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies their romantic lives their fashion or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist i really like his songs but i don't know what it is there's just something about him i don't like no that criticism is reserved for us but you know i've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art i've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade lana del rey was ruthly criticized   someone in the audience cheers  yes yeah thank you we have similar tastes i like it she was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into in my opinion the most influential artist in pop her vocal stylings her lyrics her aesthetics they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the grammys because she just kept making art and that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us  and i see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work i absolutely love i see it in lizzo rosalía tayla parx hayley kiyoko king princess camila cabello halsey megan thee stallion princess nokia nina nesbitt sigrid normani her maggie rogers becky g dua lipa ella mai billie eilish and so many other amazing women who are making music right now  female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth streaming record and ticket sales and critical acclaim so why are we doing so well because we have to grow fast we have to work this hard we have to prove that we deserve this and we have to top our last achievements women in music onstage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast we are held at a higher sometimes impossiblefeeling standard and it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it it seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger but we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in ar meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room  audience cheers  we now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade and that is the streaming world in music we're always walking handinhand with technology and sometimes that is so awesome like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday i've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes i still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up and i hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers songwriters and creators don't you  audience claps  lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that i feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry and as your resident loud person i feel the need to bring it up and that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate as if it's an app or a shoe line this just happened to me without my approval consultation or consent after i was denied the chance to purchase my music outright my entire catalogue was sold to scooter braun's ithaca holdings in a deal that i'm told was funded by the soros family  capital and the carlyle group  yet to this day none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly to perform their due diligence on their investment on their investment in me to ask how i might feel about the new owner of my art the music i wrote the videos i created photos of me my handwriting my album designs and of course scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale or even when it was announced  i'm fairly certain he knew how i would feel about it though and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying but he's always been nice to me when i'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music and of course he's nice to you if you're in this room you have something he needs the fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think according to his own social media post that he could buy me but i'm obviously not going willingly  yet the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times and i will never ever forget it like ever  audience laughs  but to conclude i will say that in ten years i've seen forward steps in our industry in our awareness our inclusion our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct i've seen the advent of social media the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists and i've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before i've leaned on that support and it has kept me in a place where no matter what i always wanted to keep making music for them  i was up on a stage in new york city in 04 accepting billboard woman of the year and i was talking about the future of streaming how we needed to make sure that the female artists writers and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly this was before my record deal with universal last year that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their spotify shares unrecupable so thank you for that  audience cheers  this speech i'm referring to was on my 5th birthday i'm about to turn thirty tonight woo but my exact quote during this speech was i really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians because somewhere right now your future woman of the year is probably sitting in a piano lesson or in a girls' choir and today right now we need to take care of her i've since learned that at that exact moment an year old girl in california really was taking piano lessons and really was in a girls' choir and this year she has been named woman of the year at the age of seventeen her name is billie  audience cheers  and those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry the ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people the ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier makes their night more fun makes their love feel more sacred or their heartache feel less isolating the ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love music and no matter what else enters the conversation we will bring it back to music  and as for me lately i've been focusing less on doing what they say i can't do and more on doing whatever the hell i want thank you for a magnificent happy free confused sometimes lonely but mostly golden decade i'm honored to be here tonight i feel very lucky to be with you thank you so much

438,Taylor Swift,"To Apple, Love Taylor",,2015,2015-06-21,i write this to explain why ill be holding back my album 989 from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  taylor

472,Taylor Swift,Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute),Woman Walk The Line ,2017,2017-09-20,i'm curled up in my mother's bed staring intently at my laptop i'm watching a video of a familiarlooking man wearing a black tuxedo the video seems to be of a televised award show the tape is grainy but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear  now i'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand her voice is full like solid gold with some platinum blended in sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes but gold is brenda's metal in this song i wish i'd wrote ladies and gentlemen brenda lee  the camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties the music starts and she's looking down at a framed picture she's at ease she is theatrical and she is beautiful in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye lights camera action she starts to sing that's when you hear the gold and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand the performance ends and the crowd goes wild the lovely lady graciously takes a bow she smiles out into the vast darkness taking it all in with grace and composure the video ends and i reflect back on what i just saw it was a timeless performance but here are the facts the year is 98 the song is someone loves you honey the man in the tuxedo is johnny cash and the woman in the beautiful dress with the honeylike voice is none other than brenda lee  brenda lee who was born in 944 near atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father brenda lee the little girl who took over the music world with charttopping hits when she was still a child brenda lee the woman who ushered in a new style of rock  roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television brenda lee the artist who later went back to her country roots proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under brenda lee the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her  i watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause there's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years brenda lee is grace brenda lee is class and composure and when she hears the roar of a crowd brenda lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation brenda lee is someone i will always look up to because of the way she shines as johnny cash said in 98 it's almost like she's golden
