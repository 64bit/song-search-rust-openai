158,Beyoncé,Yours And Mine,,nan,nan,narration beyoncé  i sometimes wish i could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else before i was famous i was the girl on the heel with the  i was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach and now that i'm famous it's really really difficult to do very simple things i think it's the hardest thing to give up but my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim never make excuses never expect anyone else to provide for me things i know i can provide for myself i have dreams and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams a reality when you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore you become the property of the public there's nothing real about it  just look at these dazzling women the finest representatives of our nation ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown  you can't put your finger on who i am i can't put my finger on who i am i am complicated i grew up with a lot of conflict and drama's and i've been through a lot just like everyone else my escape was always music and i'm so lucky that that's my job but if i accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with it would be worth nothing you know you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter you have to have something that is forever something that's invisible  i was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable and i always felt like it was my job to fix the problem people pleaser but i'm no longer afraid of conflict and i don't think conflict is a bad thing because i know that when you grow up when you learn a few things  you're no longer afraid of letting go you're no longer afraid of the unknown you're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable and it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say i like that person you know if i hadn't gone through you know some of the painful experiences in my life i would not be me and i feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary i watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective we do not value ourselves enough especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are i've always been very very specific and very choosy very choosy about what i do with my body and who i want to share that with people feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life i always considered myself a feminist although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly it's very simple it's just when you know a person that believes in equality for men and women men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other i have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created especially for africanamerican men i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through the woman has to provide so many things for their children i consider myself a humanist  you know everybody's not good at everything you know it's ok to depend on someone it's actually what we're supposed to do we're supposed to depend on each other and when you find the person that you trust and you love and you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you it is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life happiness comes from you no one else can make you happy you make you happy and one thing that's for sure the love i have for music for my husband for my child is something that will last far beyond my life

289,Beyoncé,“Self-Titled” Part 1 . The Visual Album,,2013,2013-12-13,i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today

304,Beyoncé,If I Were a Boy/You Oughta Know (Live),I Am... World Tour,nan,nan,if i were a boy even just for a day i'd roll outta bed in the morning and throw on what i wanted and go drink beer with the guys and chase after girls id kick it with who i wanted and i'd never get confronted for it cause they'd stick up for me  if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear id be a better man i'd listen to her cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed  if i were a boy i would turn off my phone tell everyone it's broken so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone i'd put myself first and make the rules as i go cause i know that she'd be faithful waitin for me to come home to come home  if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear id be a better man i'd listen to her cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted cause hes taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed  it's a little too late for you to come back say it's just a mistake think i'd forgive you like that if you thought i would wait for you you thought wrong  but youre just a boy you don't understand yeah you don't understand how it feels to love a girl someday you wish you were a better man you don't listen to her you don't care how it hurts until you lose the one you wanted cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy  i want you to know that i'm happy for you i wish nothing but the best for you both an older version of me is she perverted like me would she go down on you in a theatre does she speak eloquently and would she have your baby i'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide no and every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 'til you died but you're still alive   and i'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away it's not fair to deny me of the cross i bear that you gave to me you you you oughta know you seem very well things look peaceful i'm not quite as well i thought you should know did you forget about me mr duplicity i hate to bug you in the middle of dinner it was a slap in the face how quickly i was replaced are you thinking of me when you fuck her cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide no and every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 'til you died but you're still alive   and i'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away it's not fair to deny me of the cross i bear that you gave to me you you you oughta know  but you're just a boy yeah you don't understand until you lose the one you wanted cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy
