39,Ed Sheeran,Take It Back,× (Multiply),2014,2014-06-20,i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no   i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart covered the planet i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no i'll take it back now   now i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worstdressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  4 my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme till i deliver the hype am i just living a lie with this you must know that the numbers just sold will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 percent of it when we wake but the other 0 percent it never fades dreaming dreams of daytoday goals stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh never give up just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors now i'm sweating on the stage of a soldout tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow igh

when i get awards now the wave i had to ride the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life friends and family filled with envy when

lines and smoke in my lungs i think life has got to the point i know without it's no fun i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up instead i look in the mirror questioning what i've become i guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me without a ninetofive job or a uni degree to be caught up in the trappings of the industry they showed me the locked doors i find another use of key

save your lovin' arms for a rainy day and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser   i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs i chased the picture perfect life i think they painted it wrong i think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps because you're living your dream man this shit should be fun please know that i'm not trying to preach like i'm reverend run i beg you don't be disappointed with the man i've become our conversations with my father on the a4 age twelve telling me i've gotta chase those dreams now i'm playing for the people dad and they know me with my beat and small  wearing the same old jeans wembley stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou i may have grown up but i hope that damien's proud and to the next generation inspiration's allowed the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now somehow    i'm well

corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths to see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine cause real recognise real is what my father says and i'll be sticking to this phrase until i pass away overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow but i'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close  you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you you need me man i don't need you  interlude i got my friend very good friend random impulse

wonder in any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder under the covers where we used to lay and re stacks is what the speakers played i'd be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  just watching the dvd smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe we used each other's air just for the people to see and stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep we'd go anywhere our minds would take us and i said you are beautiful without your makeup and you don't even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way that god made us and time's the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i'm away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake say it again  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now  and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie with draw strings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone  watching blue planet creating new habits then as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can't help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i'm not saying we should be taking a break just reevaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane but in a day we'll have to say it again  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina uh won't you leave me now now  love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won't you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back go oh won't you leave me now  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both in a road won't you leave me now now

167,Ed Sheeran,Take It Back (SBTV extended version),,2014,2014-04-25,i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with a vision signs of a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paper weight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song this is like claiming i handled it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i have it this song's from the heart cover the planet i take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no and take it back now  now i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhymes 'til i deliver the hype am i just living the lie with this you must know that the number's just sold whoa will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 per cent of it when we wake but the other 0 per cent it never fades dreaming dreams day to day goals stay awake loads try to make the cut like the paper or razor blade oh never give up and just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me buskin' on the street when it was cold outdoors and now i'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pulses little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is dreams you own just set your goals and have the utmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha

180,Ed Sheeran,Take It Back / Superstition / Ain’t No Sunshine,,nan,nan,i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with a vision signs of a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paper weight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryin' act like jack black when i bring it to school i make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song since they are claiming i handled it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their

us don't you fade into the back love no and take it back now  now i don't ever wanna be perfect cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinth can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  mmmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back
