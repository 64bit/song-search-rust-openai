78,Lady Gaga,Marry The Night - ”The Prelude Pathétique”: Music Video Intro Speech,,2011,2011-12-02,the prelude pathétique first part when i look back on my life its not that i dont want to see things exactly as they happened its just that i prefer to remember them in an artistic way and truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because i invented it clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics they can be lost forever its sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting i must fill in all the ugly holes and make it beautiful again its not that i have been dishonest its just that i loathe reality  for example those nurses they're wearing next season calvin klein and so am i and the shoes custom giuseppe zanotti i tipped their gause caps to the side like parisian berets because i think it's romantic and i also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring  check out this nurse on the right she's got a great ass bam  the truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair and that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago they only gave her the gummy bears i'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears  the prelude pathétique last part you may say i lost everything but i still had my bedazzler and i had a lot of patches shiny ones from mj trimming so i wreaked havoc on some old denim and i did what any girl would do i did it all over again

227,Lady Gaga,The Manifesto of Chromatica,,2020,2020-05-29,spoken monologue when i was younger i was at some point born i grew in both iq and eq and as that happened i discovered that i was living in two realities at once they fought all the time and yet i made space for both of them for a reason i can't explain one reality i experienced was my earth reality the day today painting of what i was taught was my natural state in life at the time i also experienced a dream simultaneously and this dream was in combat with my earth reality at all times a vision where i perform my thoughts for the world a world where i mattered in a different way a world where i was valued for different things and in this world i was kind and that kindness spread through people through sound this was the birth of chromatica  love is an element on chromatica like earth wind fire water it's a natural force and it's the only way that i can organize this super organism that is the earth it's by making it one whole thing where time and linear structure don't matter they don't exist we are all love i am love so it's everything around us it's how we work it's the thing we both initiate and respond to it's why everything happens both good and bad it's the only way that i can make things simple and why shouldn't it be simple i breathe in and out love i don't believe it to be a choice other than i choose to breathe that is chromatica it is how i do hard things it's neither right nor wrong nor is it greater or less than any other perspective on life no one thing is greater than another kindness rules all things it simply is and it's mine you can have it too though my best friend says sharing is caring but we both know that i don't need to share your perspective with you for us both to care  the manifesto of chromatica it's neverending i cannot finish it here it would be declaring i would never make music or be lady gaga again which would mean i would stop being myself this manifesto finale marks the new beginning of my life one where i acknowledge that sound is my life force and that lady gaga is the mystery that carries it chromatica can't end it's how i make sense of things that's what you should tell people if they ask you what it is and for what is worth i think we all need that to make sense of things even if at times it feels absurd

339,Lady Gaga,Lady Gaga takes tea with Mr Fry,,nan,nan,stephen fry i know people talk to you about all the same things but one of the things i just wanted to talk to you about because its so obvious coming here is the thing i think that you always say is most important to you which is the fans and theyre all outside and i gather you took them out some hot chocolate  lady gaga actually well i sent them hot chocolate yesterday and macaroons and then today i had press all day and i felt bad because i usually would leave the hotel and i would go to say hi but i knew that i wouldnt have time and theyd be waiting all day so i just went down and i brought them some fresh cookies and flowers  sf ooooh and do you find theres a difference between your fans in different countries or is there a sort of similarity is there a kind of gaga fan who has a commonality  lg yes there is the little monsters are a community and its kind of nice that everywhere i go they create a little home for me  sf both those who i suppose describe themselves as your critics and those who adore you as i do im unashamed to say would concentrate on the fact that you are quite happy to be self consciously a spokesman for the dispossessed the marginal the freakish the outsider the sexually different the ugly the fat the one who doesnt fit in the one who feels outside the tribe if you like  lg yes it could be anybody sf which in fact is most of us none of us really feels we belong just some of us are better at hiding it than others lg i think so some of us wear the mask prouder than others sf yes exactly and the title of this album is the one that most directly addresses that i suppose born this way and the title song of it lg yes the album is about being able to be reborn over and over again throughout your life sf oh so its not just that god made me gay or god made me lesbian or god made me bi and thats who i am lg no sf its about being reborn is it lg no not really
